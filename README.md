- Frontend: React, Axios
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (optional, fallback CSS included)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Node.js 16+ and npm or yarn

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the backend folder (or root if combined):

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <backend-folder>
    ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a PostgreSQL database for the app.

5. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
    ```

6. Run the Flask backend server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

7. (Optional) To create the database table and insert sample data, POST to:

    ```
    http://localhost:5000/api/debug/create-table
    ```

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the React frontend folder (e.g., `client`):

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

### Notes on Styling

- The React app uses Tailwind CSS for styling by default.
- If you cannot install or use Tailwind, replace `src/App.css` with the provided fallback CSS and import it into `App.js`.
- Tailwind installation requires Node.js and proper setup; consult [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) if needed.

## Usage

- Add a movie by filling the form and clicking **Add Movie**.
- Edit an existing movie by clicking **Edit**, modifying fields, then **Update Movie**.
- Delete a movie by clicking **Delete**.
- The watch date must not be a future date.
- Ratings must be between 0 and 10.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct.
- Backend runs on port `5000` by default.
- Frontend runs on port `3000` by default.
- If CORS issues occur, ensure Flask-CORS is enabled.
- For date validation, ensure your system date/time is correct.
